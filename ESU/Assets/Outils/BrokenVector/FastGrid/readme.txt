FASTGRID

Thank you for purchasing FastGrid!

This editor plugin allows you to snap your scene objects to a customizable grid.

To open the editor window navigate to Tools -> FastGrid


You will see two buttons:
The first one enables/disables snapping.
The second shows/hides the grid.

Use the field "Snap Value" to specify the distance to the next snap-point. In most cases this value should be equal to the size of the object you want to snap. 

The "Rotation Snap" field is used to set the snapping angle in degrees when rotating a object.


Please rate our product on the Unity Asset Store if you like it!

Happy Snapping!
